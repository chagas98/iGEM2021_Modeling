# SynFronteras iGEM UNILA - BioPank Modeling

SynFronteras iGEM Team (UNILA_LatAm) represented the Federal University of Latin American Integration (UNILA) in Interantional Genetically Engineered Machine Competition 2021.

As detailed in the [BioPank project's Wiki](https://2021.igem.org/Team:UNILA_LatAm/Model), we built a kinetic model with parameter optimization, where an Ordinary DIfferential Equations (ODEs) framework coupled with sensitivity analysis evaluates the performance of our chassis (bacteria) under variable conditions in the midgut of the vector and of the engineered genetic circuit to eliminate leishmania.
